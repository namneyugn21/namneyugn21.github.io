# **Nam's personal website**

## Introduction <br>
Currently, I am trying to design my website in a minimal (and aesthetic) way, and with that being said, I will use this opportunity to incorporate my basic React skills that I learn by myself in my free time. <br>
In addition, I will also use different UI components provided on the internet, and I have to be honest, I have no idea what does code means. Right now, the components that I use are from [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/components/background-beams),
and the components are coded using Tailwind and Typescript. <br>

## My Goal <br>
As stated earlier, my goal is to make a appealing personal website for myself while apply my basic React knowledge, rather than trying to master any framework or library. I know that most of the components I used on the internet might not easy to understand for me, but of course, I still try to understand what on Earth is going on :)
